## Designing with empathy for the human experience.
**(I like solving meaningful problems with pretty solutions)**

🚀 My Mission:
I believe that tech should be exciting and empowering. My goal is to inspire curiosity, boost productivity, and spread the joy of learning through technology.

👩‍💻 What I Do:
Web Dev: From concept to code, I craft delightful websites that stand out from the digital crowd.
Tech Tutoring: I demystify coding, web design, AI, and automation, making them as easy as pie for learners of all levels.

💡 My Approach:
I'm all about mixing a pinch of creativity with a dash of innovation to cook up solutions that are as practical as they are delightful.
